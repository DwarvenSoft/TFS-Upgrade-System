# Upgrade System

Tibia has flat, dull, boring and not fun items system, time to change it. Expand your server with a lot of possibilities to make grinding more satisfying. No more useless items laying around and being ignored by others, now every item can be powerful. Using special crystals, items can be upgraded with new stats and powerful attributes. New property - Item Level - which determines how powerful given item is. A lot of crystals to upgrade items even further.

## Item Level
Item Level (iLvl) is set for every wearable item when dropped by a monster.
Default iLvl is calculated using special algorithm that determines monster level/power based on its Max HP and Experience.
Then additional iLvl value is given based on base item stats (Atk, Def, Armor, Hit Chance). After all of that, additional stats are calculated based on item iLvl.
Upgrading item level increases iLvl in addition to bonus stats and values for bonus attributes are based on iLvl of the item.
Given all of that I have made every item different. If you drop a Giant Sword from a Behemoth and a Giant Sword from a Ferumbras they will be different in stats.
You may ask "What if someone loots Sword from high level monster and a new player gets it? That's unbalanced." but don't be afraid.
If player level is lower than iLvl of given items, they **can't** equip them!

## Unique Items
